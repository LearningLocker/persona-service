# Notes
- The tests in this directory test the service functions defined in ./../serviceFactory/Service.ts
- There are other directories in this project called "tests" that test utils
- All test files to be executed by Mocha, should have the ".test.ts" file extension
- It is recommended that you create a folder to test each of the service functions
- Avoid the use of the `it` and `describe` functions in utils because it prevents use of `only`
